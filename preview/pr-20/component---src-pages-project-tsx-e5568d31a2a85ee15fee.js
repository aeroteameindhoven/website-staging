Our goal is to create a network of drones that can interact with each other on a whole new level.

Using this network, we can connect Europe through the sky, in a sustainable way, electrically. We want to create the technology that enables the first steps of this network."),n.createElement("p",null,"The idea is that a cargo drone, transporting high priority products or necessities, is refueled in air by a second drone. The second drone carries a second battery and will switch the empty cargo battery using artificial intelligence. The cargo drone flies past charging points, created by our network. By creating this battery swap technology, we can innovate alongside the battery developments which will reduce the amount of swaps in time."))))))}}}]);
